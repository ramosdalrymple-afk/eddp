# Payout and Fees

#### How payouts work

After an Event Closed, resolution criteria are checked and confirmed. Once a Resolution event has occurred:

* The correct Outcome is identified.
* All trades on that Outcome share in the losing pools.
* The payout is based on:
* how much money was in each Outcome’s pool,&#x20;
* how big each user’s position was in the winning Outcome, and
* how early they got involved in the outcome

Users see final results in their account as profit or loss.

#### What are the fees?

EveryX charges a small platform fee from the losing side in each Event.

Key points:

* Fees are taken from the losers.
* There are no deposit fees from EveryX.
* No interest on leveraged positions.
* No complex maker/taker fees or funding rates.

The fee structure is intentionally simple so that KOLs, partners, and users can easily understand how the platform earns money and what users can expect to receive when they win.

#### Event lifecycle

Each Event moves through a few clear stages:

1. Upcoming – Event is created, trading opens at a scheduled time.
2. Live – Trading is open, users can enter or adjust trades.
3. Closed – Trading stops before the real-world outcome is known (for example, at the start of a match or at a cutoff time).
4. Pending Resolution – The Event is closed, and EveryX is collecting the final information needed to decide the correct Outcome.
5. Resolved – The correct Outcome is confirmed, payouts are distributed.
6. Inactive – Event is frozen or cancelled due to external issues (e.g. data problems, ambiguity, or other unexpected events).

If an Event is cancelled or cannot be fairly resolved, EveryX has policies to return funds to users. Please refer to the detailed, event-specific Rules when trading.
